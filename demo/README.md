# Aili-Demo

Demo application that showcases [Aili-Translate](../translate),
[Aili-Parser](../parser), and [Aili-Vis](../vis).

The application contains two mockup State graphs
and several pre-written example stylesheets.
Stylesheets may be edited directly in the app.

This demo app runs entirely within the browser.

## Build

The application can be packaged into a fully stand-alone distribution.
Make sure that [Aili-JSAPI](../jsapi/README.md#generate-node-package)
is already built.

```sh
npm run build
```

## Development Server

The application can also be run on a development server.
Again, [Aili-JSAPI](../jsapi/README.md#generate-node-package)
must be built before starting the server.

```sh
npm run start
```
